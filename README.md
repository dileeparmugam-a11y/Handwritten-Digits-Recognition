🧠 Handwritten Digits Recognition (MNIST)

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to accurately recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The objective is to implement end-to-end data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and performance comparison using Python-based ML libraries.

📌 Project Overview

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). In this project, I developed and evaluated classification models to automatically identify digits with high accuracy.

The workflow includes:
Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature scaling and normalization
Model training and hyperparameter tuning
Model evaluation using performance metrics
Accuracy comparison and results interpretation
